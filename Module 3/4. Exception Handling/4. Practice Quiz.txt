Question 3

Consider the following code:

If the user enters the value of `b’ as 0, what is expected as the output?
 
    a = 1
try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a: "))
    a = a / b
    print("Success a =", a)
except:
    print("There was an error")

 


Success a=1/0

There was an error

Success a=NaN

ZeroDivisionError
