Question 1

Which of the following statements will create an object ‘C1’ for the class that uses radius as 4 and color as ‘yellow’?


class Circle(object):
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, radius=3, color='blue'):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color


    # Method
    def add_radius(self, r):
        self.radius = self.radius + r
        return self.radius
        
        
        C1 = Circle(‘yellow’,4)

C1 = Circle(4, ‘yellow’)

C1.radius = Circle.radius(4)

 C1.color = Circle.color(‘yellow’)

C1 = Circle()
Status: [object Object]

Question 2

Consider the execution of the following lines of code.

CircleObject = Circle()

CircleObject.radius = 10

What are the values of the radius and color attributes for the CircleObject after their execution?

class Circle(object):
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, radius=3, color='blue'):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color
        
    # Method
    def add_radius(self, r):
        self.radius = self.radius + r
        return self.radius

10, ‘blue’

3, ‘red’

3, ‘blue’

10, ‘red’
Status: [object Object]

Question 3

What is the color attribute of the object V1?

class Vehicle:
    color = "white"


    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.seating_capacity = None


    def assign_seating_capacity(self, seating_capacity):
        self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity


V1 = Vehicle(150, 25)

Question 4

Which of the following options would create an appropriate object that points to a red, 5-seater vehicle with a maximum speed of 200kmph and a mileage of 20kmpl?

  class Vehicle:
    color = "white"


    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.seating_capacity = None


    def assign_seating_capacity(self, seating_capacity):
        self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity


V1 = Vehicle(150, 25)

Car = Vehicle(200, 20)

Car = Vehicle(200,20)

  Car.color = ‘red’

  Car.assign_seating_capacity(5)

Car = Vehicle(200,20)

  Car.color = ‘red’

Car = Vehicle(200,20)

  Car.assign_seating_capacity(5)

Question 5

What is the value printed upon execution of the code shown below

 class Graph():
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.id = 80


val = Graph(200)
print(val.id)

 80
 200
